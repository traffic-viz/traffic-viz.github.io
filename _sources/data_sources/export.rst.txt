How to export and store trajectory and airspace data?
=====================================================

The traffic library is based on the `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
library for representing and manipulating trajectories and on the `shapely
<https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library for manipulating
geographical information like airways, beacons, airports and airspaces.

Various parsers are provided (feel free to file a PR if you use other tools
with different data sources) but after applying different operations to
imported data, you may want to export data for storing, sharing and loading
again later.

Traffic and Flight structures
-----------------------------

The question applies to pandas dataframes as well, with many opinions
available on the net. In general, the question boils down to whether you want
to distribute the data, how fast you need to access it and how long you need
to keep it.

- | CSV (comma separated values) is a pretty standard and widely acknowledged
    format (modulo the definition of the separator). It is easy to parse but it
    can be slow when data gets large. Also it doesnâ€™t contain information about
    types so you need to check dtypes and transform them manually if need be. A
    good rule of thumb could be to parse CSV data only once and to use another
    format for storing it for future use.

- | JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is another lightweight text notation,
    human readable, also slow to parse. The added value compared to CSV is that
    you can distinguish boolean, numerical and string values.

- | `Pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ is the standard
    format for Python serialisation. The binary representation of data is dumped
    as is in a file, no question asked. It is fast to read and write and you are
    sure to recover your data after you restart your Python interpreter/kernel.
    The downside is that the serialisation format may change with Python and
    pandas versions so it is not a good format for sharing and storing data in
    the time.

- | HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) is a cross platform and cross language
    standard format for storing very large amounts of data. You may need extra
    dependencies to read and write from this format.

- | `Apache Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/>`_ is another columnar cross
    platform and cross language standard storage format. Its implementation
    inside pandas is very fast for both read and write operations and the
    resulting files are rather compact. Types are respected but all Python
    structures (like sets, lists and dictionaries) may not be directly
    exportable. You may need extra dependencies to read and write from this
    format.

The `Flight <traffic.core.flight.html>`_ and `Traffic
<traffic.core.traffic.html>`_ structures implement the following methods:

.. autoclass:: traffic.core.mixins.DataFrameMixin()
  :members: from_file, to_csv, to_json, to_pickle, to_hdf, to_parquet

Airspace structures
-------------------

Airspaces are manipulated as GeoPandas GeoDataFrame.

The most appropriate format for exporting such data is probably the JSON format,
which happens to also be compatible with many GIS toolsets and JavaScript
visualisation libraries.

However, there are two types of JSON formats for geometries:

- | the **GeoJSON** format is the closest to the data we parse. You can export
    it directly from any GeoDataFrame, with the ``.to_json()``. The community
    tends to prefer the ``.geojson`` suffix for this kind of files.

- | the **TopoJSON** format presents many advantages over the GeoJSON format.
    Data is stored as arcs and objects, and a single segment (an arc) may be
    referenced by many objects. More advanced tricks help keeping a file size
    often about 6 times smaller than the size of a **GeoJSON**.

Exports to TopoJSON may require the use of external libraries, such as `topojson
<https://github.com/mattijn/topojson>`_.

.. warning::

    The difficult part about exporting to TopoJSON is the detection of arcs
    which may be shared by several objects. If arcs are not exact matches for
    both sides of a border, this may lead to invalid topologies.  This is not a
    problem of the TopoJSON format, but a problem of data curation, under the
    responsibility of the data provider.
